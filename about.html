      <h3>Hey, I'm Shiro!</h3>
      <p>
I'm a cybersecurity speciailist but I do a bit of web development such as this website I made for a portfolio, I like eating, playing video games- I love my parents and my sweet dogs and my hot-headed sister.</p>
      <p>
        This style of website is what I thought of I made on my own, I didn't really copy any template from other websites but funnily enough I was supposed to go with a school style type of website that goes with the frutiger aero type of vibe, but hey It needs to be original and I deliver original.
